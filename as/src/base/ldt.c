/* LDT Module
 *  BASICS
 *
 *    Structure: LDT bins are the bin types which can store large or linked
 *               data. The structures as
 *
 *              +------------------------------------------------------------
 * LDT RECORD   |       LDT BIN                  |                |     .....
 *              +------------------------------------------------------------
 *                  |  |        |       |
 *           +------+  +-----+  +-----+ +-----+
 *           | ESR  |  | SUB |  | SUB | | SUB |
 *           +------+  +-----+  +-----+ +-----+
 *                      |   |            |   |
 *                +-----+   +-----+      |   |
 *                | SUB |   | SUB |      |   |
 *                +-----+   +-----+      |   |

 *                                 +-----+   +-----+
 *
 *  There are three parts to it
 *
 *  LDT RECORD : Which is the parent record which contain LDT bin type.
 *  LDT ESR    : It is LDT existence record one corresponding to each LDT bin.
 *  LDT SUBREC : Many different LDT subrecords which linked together to
 *               implement Large(linked) data type. The structure/organization
 *               and links between these are user programmable.
 *  LDT SUB    : SUBREC + ESR are collectively called SUB
 *
 *  LDT bin type is user exposed type AS_LDT. This type of bin can only be
 *  manipulated through System User Defined Function (SDF), through specially
 *  implemented functions.
 *
 *  Three types of maps
 *
 *  Record Property Map:  RPM_*
 *  Property Map:         PM__*
 *
 *  HIDDEN BIN TO STORE METADATA INFO
 *
 *              +------------------------------------------------------------
 * LDT RECORD   | REC_LDT_CTRL_BIN type:RPM |  LDT BIN  | LDT BIN | ....
 *              +------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *              +--------------------------------
 * LDT BIN      | list {type:PM, type:M} | .....
 *              +--------------------------------
 *
 *              +------------------------------------------------------
 * LDT SUBREC   | SUBREC_PROP_BIN type:PM | other lua specific stuff | .....
 *              +-----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *              +------------------------------------------------------
 * LDT ESR      | SUBREC_PROP_BIN type:PM | ???
 *              +-----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *
 *  Example of implementation of (Large) Linked Data Type is LSTACK/LLIST/LSET.
 *
 *  ldt_aerospike.c ldt_record.c implement as_aerospike / as_record to expose
 *  primitives which are used by LUA to implement LDT.
 *
 *  This file implements functionality which is required for handling server
 *  side functionality like maintenance / expiry / expiration / deletion /
 *  read / write / migration / duplication resolution for the aerospike
 *  records containing Large (linked) data type bins.
 *
 *
 *  Major Changes:
 *
 *  - Partition structure will have its own tree from which the LDT subrecord
 *    will be hanging. This is to make sure LDT record and LDT subrecord
 *    has different search space. This is avoid digest collision between two
 *    spaces.
 *
 *  - The LDT subrecord has its own digest to identify it. Following logic is used to
 *    make sure that in entire life of server no two subrecord digest which is
 *    generated repeat.  [See ldt_aerospike.c for randomizer function ]
 *
 *      - 12 bits of partition distinguishing bits and hence LDT_SUB for record
 *        in two different partition are in different space. This also means the
 *        when LDT_SUB digest is generated on two different nodes they can never
 *        collide as at any point of time the write to record in a given partition
 *        happens only on one node.
 *
 *      - 2 bytes for lock has [2-3] for same lock
 *
 *      - 3 random bytes to make sure of uniqueness. At a given clock time on
 *        multiple node. [4-6]. The see for this random number if picked from
 *        the digest itself to make it thread safe for a digest.
 *
 *      - 1 byte to for the storage distribution ... [7]. We want to make sure
 *        LDT subrecord falls on the same device as the LDT record
 *
 *      - 6 bytes are based on system clock [8-14]
 *
 *      - 6 bytes of version which is generated at partition version creation
 *
 *
 *  - Every time partition migrates in it will generate a new version for the given
 *    LDT. This is to make sure that all the incoming subrecord will have new digest
 *    so the subrecord never collide and create new copies. When the parent record
 *    of the winner LDT moves in it will have the partition version stamped in it.
 *    All the subrecord will be lazily / aggressively cleaned up from the system.
 *    [ See migrate.c for the detail code for this ]
 *
 *  - Read/Write: Because LDT are huge size we cannot ship get op (duplicate
 *    resolution) for entire record. So for the records with LDT bins the request
 *    is send to all the duplicates [writes/UDF] as well, with the protection at
 *    the initiating node (master if it is sync / origin [acting master node] in
 *    case of proxy). In case op is read the result is returned back to the
 *    originating node along with the generation and winner result is sent back
 *    to the client. In case of write after applying UDF then normal replication
 *    is triggered to send result to replica set along with generation. And the
 *    winner generation wins. Need better solution. Also it is necessary to make
 *    sure that the ops have order what it means is when the op is send it gets
 *    executed unless cluster view has changed. [ ldt.c / proxy.c / thr_rw.c to
 *    see the shipped op logic ]
 *
 *    NB: See code for the details of locking and protection mechanism. And
 *        ACID semantics
 *    NB: See the code comments for the details of reducing the network bandwidth.
 *
 *  - Replication: Replication at both at the time of the duplicates/migration
 *    and at the normal runtime would pack entire changes done to LDT into one
 *    packet and send it over to the replica set. This is to make sure the
 *    Atomic semantics becomes less dependent on the network "finickiness". And
 *    make sure entire thing makes to replica [We still not solved the case
 *    where entire thing either makes to the storage or none makes it. But
 *    that cane be independent additional change]
 *
 *  - Migration: At the source of migrations the migration runs reduce on the
 *    primary and creates the list of the subrecord which is part of it. Then
 *    it walk through the subrecord and ships the entire list. Along with the
 *    sub record it sends generation of the parent LDT record and also the
 *    partition version. And in the end ships the LDT record.
 *
 *    At the target of the migration. All the incoming migrating subrecord
 *    is accepted and inserted into the migrate subrecord tree. The sub record
 *    is not accepted if incoming generation cannot win. [OPTIMIZATION: If
 *    the first subrecord (which is sent along with generation) fails to win
 *    then the entire LDT shipping is aborted to save the network band width]
 *    When finally the parent LDT is received then reduce function is run so
 *    in single context all the subrecord are moved from migrate tree to the
 *    main tree.
 *
 *    Sub record also has the partition version hidden bin. This is needed
 *    to make sure both version can coexist on the storage. So the cold restart
 *    can handle it. See cold restart logic for more detail of its usage.
 *
 *  - Expiry / Eviction : Nsup threads only runs on the LDT record tree. If
 *    the parent record is deleted then all the existence subrecord are deleted
 *    from the sub record tree. See the logic the version cleaned and delete
 *    thread logic for sub record tree for details of how subrecord gets cleaned
 *    up. (NOTE: NSup refers to the Namespace Supervisor thread, which takes
 *    care of record expiration and eviction.)
 *
 *  - Warm restart : Both the record and subrecord are tree are allocated from
 *    arena shared memory .. attaching at the boot time simply bring back the
 *    entire state of system as it was when the node went down.
 *
 *  - Subrecord Version clean / delete: A background thread walk through the
 *    sub record main tree and keep checking if the existence record is present
 *    for the LDT subrecord ... if it exists then it checks to see if the LDT
 *    parent record version matches. If it does not match the version of LDT
 *    subrecord is cleaned up. If it matches the version is retained. In case
 *    existence sub record is missing the subrecord is cleaned up from the
 *    sub record tree.
 *
 *    NB: When the bin is deletes the ESR record is simply deleted from the
 *    sub record tree. And LDT subrecords are lazily cleaned up.
 *
 *    See the details in code in case two different ESR show up for two
 *    different versions of LDT.
 *
 *  - Defrag : Defrag when walking through storage looks up key in both record
 *    tree and sub record tree. If not found the record is candidate for defrag.

 * LDT Read/Write/apply UDF Algorithm
 *
 * When the user request reaches the master or acting master (in case master is

 * acting master)
 * Following code path is followed
 *
 * -- thr_tsvc
 *    -- as_rw_start
 *       -- internal_rw_start
 *
 * In case duplicate resolution is triggered and if in the duplicates that are
 * received, if any has LDT bin, there can two possible cases
 *  case 1: The record which wins the duplicate resolution has LDT bin
 *  case 2: The record which wins the duplicate resolution does not have
 *          LDT bin.
 *
 * In case 2 the winner record is written locally and then normal code path of
 * read/write/UDF apply is followed.
 *
 * NB: When duplicate resolution request is received by the node having duplicate
 *     version of partition it only sends back the place holder for the LDT bins
 *     and not the entire record. [Reason being the entire record with LDT bin may
 *     be prohibitively large. There could some sort of bounds of up to which size
 *     it can sent and after which it cannot be for duplicate resolution, but this
 *     could mean sending back many records in one single packet].
 *
 * In case 1 the Read/Write/UDF apply is sent to the winner node. At the winner
 * node the op (winner node actually creates transaction has write hash etc and
 * lock; this actually means the synchronization is done both at the master and
 * the node where op is being performed .. but write hash entry is needed so that
 * winner node can replicate) ... in case the task is running on winner node which
 * is migrating its partition to the remote the replication has some special
 * condition where in it has to make sure that unless the partition has reached
 * the record replication stage only subrecords are sent And in case the partition
 * is still being replicated in the subrecord go into migrate tree [please see the
 * details of migration in the migration logic section].
 *
 * Weird (unexpected) Cases
 *
 * 1. If replication is slow for some reason and the client request times out.
 *    Not sure how to handle it.
 *
 * 2. If the winner node dies without replicating ... then the data is kind of
 *    un available and probably lost if the LDT bin get updates in the node's
 *    absence. We still do not have mechanism of merging LDT ...
 *
 * NB: In future if we decide to do record merging instead of the entire one
